# Magic-Spell-Casting-Game
Developed an immersive Magic Spell Casting Game Simulator, building upon and expanding the concepts from three foundational lab assignments. The project involved:

Data Collection: Utilized an Arduino IMU sensor to capture real-time data for the dataset, enabling precise tracking of user movements and gestures during gameplay.
Model Implementation: Applied the Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (BiGRU) model for effective classification of user gestures, allowing accurate mapping of actions to in-game spellcasting mechanics.
Game Integration: Seamlessly integrated the system into Unity 3D, delivering an interactive and immersive gaming experience where user gestures control magic spellcasting in real time.
This project showcases expertise in hardware integration, machine learning, and game development while providing an engaging user experience through gesture recognition and real-time feedback.
